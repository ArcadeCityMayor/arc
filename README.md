## Status

- We are rebranding from Arc to Arcade.
- We are doing a major refactor for our first MVP beta build v0.1.0. Main branch will be under heavy development.
- Our latest build [v0.0.5-alpha](https://github.com/ArcadeLabsInc/arcade/releases/tag/v0.0.5-alpha) can be downloaded via TestFlight (iOS) or APK (Android).
- You can run v0.0.5 locally using [this branch](https://github.com/ArcadeLabsInc/arcade/tree/3e4e7efa9bacca60f4932607c22e1aaa0a7dba63).

## v0.1.0 Refactor

As of April 30, we are beginning a refactor:

- Switching to the new [expo-router](https://expo.github.io/router/docs) pattern
- Focusing first on a web app @ [arcade.chat](https://arcade.chat)
- We'll continue building cross-platform components via [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/)
